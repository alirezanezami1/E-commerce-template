## It was the first project in which I wanted to use jQuery, and I am showing you my folder structure. It was an interesting experience, and jQuery can still be a very helpful tool depending on the needs of the project! :

<div>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53ba92dd-b6fb-47df-97ba-e484f231279f" style="width: 100%;"/>
</div>

## Home

<div>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbd38bb1-2934-465a-aa32-7d9eb7099a01" style="width: 100%;"/>
</div>

### One of the challenging pages in this project was the vendor page, where we needed to add and remove several features to the template, and building this CMS with plain JS was challenging.

## seller.html
<div>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29d6f99e-f8a8-4e0e-bec6-5363f15f301a" style="width: 100%;"/>
</div>

### For the products section, three types of filters are used:
- Category filter
- Price filter
- Color filter"

  <div>
